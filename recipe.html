                <h2 id="recipe-title">Cauliflower Tartine With Romesco Sauce</h2>
                <p id="recipe-todo">
                <h4>Steps to do :</h4>
                Step 1 : Preheat oven to 400°F. Thinly slice half of the cauliflower half (leaving core
                intact) and set aside remaining cauliflower half. Place cauliflower slices and raisins in a heat-safe
                bowl.
                Place water, 1/2 cup of the vinegar, 1 of the smashed garlic cloves, and ½ teaspoon of the salt in a
                saucepan
                and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Remove from heat and pour mixture over cauliflower and raisins
                in bowl
                and stir gently. Allow to pickle at room temperature at least 15 minutes or up to 30 minutes. Drain
                pickling
                liquid; discard or reserve for another use. <br />

                Step 2 : While cauliflower mixture pickles, cut remaining half of the cauliflower half into small
                florets and
                spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Toss with 1 teaspoon of the oil and 1/8 teaspoon of
                the
                salt. Place in preheated oven and roast until cauliflower is tender and golden brown on the underside,
                18 to
                20 minutes, stirring halfway through cook time. Remove from oven. <br />

                Step 3 : Place almonds, roasted bell peppers, tomato paste, black pepper, crushed red pepper, and
                remaining 1
                tablespoon vinegar, 1 smashed clove garlic, ½ teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons oil in a food processor
                and
                process until mostly smooth, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. <br />

                Step 4 : Spread sauce evenly over toasted bread slices. Top with pickled cauliflower slices and roasted
                cauliflower florets. Garnish with parsley and crushed red pepper. <br /></p>

                baking sheet.

                    <h2 id="recipe-title">Cauliflower Tartine With Romesco Sauce</h2>
                    <p id="recipe-todo">
                    <h4>Steps to do :</h4>
                    Step 1 : Preheat oven to 400°F. Thinly slice half of the cauliflower half (leaving core
                    intact) and set aside remaining cauliflower half. Place cauliflower slices and raisins in a
                    heat-safe bowl.
                    Place water, 1/2 cup of the vinegar, 1 of the smashed garlic cloves, and ½ teaspoon of the salt in a
                    saucepan
                    and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Remove from heat and pour mixture over cauliflower and
                    raisins in bowl
                    and stir gently. Allow to pickle at room temperature at least 15 minutes or up to 30 minutes. Drain
                    pickling
                    liquid; discard or reserve for another use. <br />

                    Step 2 : While cauliflower mixture pickles, cut remaining half of the cauliflower half into small
                    florets and
                    spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Toss with 1 teaspoon of the oil and 1/8 teaspoon
                    of the
                    salt. Place in preheated oven and roast until cauliflower is tender and golden brown on the
                    underside, 18 to
                    20 minutes, stirring halfway through cook time. Remove from oven. <br />

                    Step 3 : Place almonds, roasted bell peppers, tomato paste, black pepper, crushed red pepper, and
                    remaining 1
                    tablespoon vinegar, 1 smashed clove garlic, ½ teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons oil in a food
                    processor and
                    process until mostly smooth, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. <br />

                    Step 4 : Spread sauce evenly over toasted bread slices. Top with pickled cauliflower slices and
                    roasted
                    cauliflower florets. Garnish with parsley and crushed red pepper. <br /></p>

                    minutes.
                    Transfer to a food processor and let mixture cool at least 5 minutes. Wipe skillet clean. <br />

                    Step : 2 Add rice, panko, flour, pepper, and remaining¾teaspoon salt to food processor. Pulse until
                    mixture
                    comes together, about 15 times. (Mixture will be sticky.) Form into 8 balls (about the size of golf
                    balls).
                    <br />

                    Step : 3 Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add meatballs
                    and cook,
                    turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. <br />

                    Step : 4 Preheat broiler with oven rack 8 inches from heat source. Place toasted rolls on a rimmed
                    baking sheet.
                    Spread ½ cup of the tomato sauce evenly inside rolls. Top with meatballs, remaining ½ cup tomato
